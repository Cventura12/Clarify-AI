# Clarify ? Personal Execution Layer

## Summary
Clarify turns natural language requests into executed admin work through a three?stage pipeline: Interpret ? Plan ? Execute. It handles follow?ups, deadlines, and documents with human approval built in.

## Problem
Life admin tasks are repetitive, scattered across portals, and constantly stealing time. Most tools only organize tasks ? they don?t complete them.

## Solution
Clarify automates the work:
- Interpret intent from natural language
- Plan steps with priority and dependencies
- Execute actions (draft emails, generate docs, set reminders)

## Key Features
- Human?in?the?loop approvals
- Context memory and smart suggestions
- Integrations with calendars + tools
- Audit trail (roadmap)

## Status
- Demo?ready pipeline
- Mock integrations + diagnostics
- DB and LLM integration pending env keys

## Next
- Connect LLM + database
- Ship real integrations
- Pilot with students and job seekers
