# Demo Script (2-3 minutes)

## Opening (15s)
"Clarify is a personal execution layer. You describe a task, it interprets intent, plans steps, and executes actions with human approval."

## Step 1: Interpret (30s)
"I?ll paste a real task: ?Follow up on my internship application and set a reminder for next week.?"
"Clarify turns it into structured intent and tasks, and flags any missing context."

## Step 2: Plan (30s)
"Next, the plan breaks it into steps and assigns a priority score. You can see the ordered plan immediately."

## Step 3: Execute + Approve (45s)
"Clarify proposes actions. I approve the email draft."
"Now we have a clean draft plus a follow?up suggestion and notifications."

## Step 4: Intelligence (30s)
"The AI diagnostics view shows reasoning steps, a confidence score, and fallback strategies."

## Step 5: Integrations (20s)
"Integrations are ready to connect to Calendar, Notion, and Slack. OAuth is stubbed until credentials are added."

## Close (10s)
"That?s Clarify: interpret, plan, and execute with oversight. Next up is full LLM + DB?backed automation."
